Q: "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50."
A: Let’s think step by step. In the question "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50.", we are asked:
"the buildings which have rooms" so we need column = [classroom.capacity]
"rooms with capacity" so we need column = [classroom.building]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [50]. So the Schema_links are:
